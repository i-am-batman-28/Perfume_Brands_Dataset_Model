This is a Perfume Brands Dataset Project where a dataset which contains different perfume brands were selected and after complete model training and building using regression models on target variable 'price', we understand various trends and the best model that can be used for this dataset. We summarise that the best model used here is 'RandomForestRegressor' with the min mean squared error of 37.35
